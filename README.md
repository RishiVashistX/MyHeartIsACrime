# MyHeartIsACrime
My heart is a crime is a game I created in grade 7, with another person in my team who handled the poster making and so called "marketing" of the game. The game was about a demon posessing a character and his quest to overcome the demon and free himself of the posession. It is a passion project of grade 7. The game is incomplete. This game is created on RPG Maker MV, due to the img folder and audio folder being too large, I did not upload them here.
